## Note

By default, the frontend points to the hosted backend on Render:

https://ecommerce-platform-backend-n9wx.onrender.com
```

If running the backend locally, update all axios URLs inside the App.jsx file like this:

```bash
https://ecommerce-platform-backend-n9wx.onrender.com
```

Change:

```bash
https://ecommerce-platform-backend-n9wx.onrender.com
```

To:

```bash
http://localhost:5001
```

Make sure to create a `.env` file in the backend folder if running locally. 
üëâ For environment variable setup, see the [Backend README](https://github.com/vishvak8/ecommerce-platform-backend#-setup-instructions).
